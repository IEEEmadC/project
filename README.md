# project



Team Name:	Proxima
This project will help the society to reduce and make people aware about people suffering from any of the indicator of Multi-dimensional poverty i.e. Lack of health, education, lack of standard of living around them so that people can access to them, and help them accordingly, in less time. 

If user saw any person who need help or is suffering from any of the indicator, he will insert his data and picture, app will automatically trace his location and will notify people around him. The app will tell people about the type of help that is needed whether it is food, clothes, books, fund, medicine, etc. App will show his location and status on map. Status will be black if not helped at all, yellow if not completely helped or green if completely helped.

It will show visual data to let people know about statistics of areas suffering, how many people are helped, how many are remaining, and indicators which are more prominent.

The people who will help will get points and can share these points on Facebook and will get appreciation from his/her friends, that will motivate him to do more.
